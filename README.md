Carrie Liang | Data Analyst in NYC | Making overthinking productive

🌸 Hi! I’m Carrie, a current analyst and future data scientist. I turn overthinking into deeper insights, viewing problems at any and all angles and crafting a meaningful story from data.

📚 Background: Earned a Bachelor’s in Biopsychology, Cognition, and Neuroscience (BCN) with minor in Linguistics from the University of Michigan. Currently, I'm working on a Master’s in Analytics from Georgia Tech.

💭 Endlessly curious: I’m a data nerd constantly looking for the “why?” and seeking new challenges.

🛠 Toolkit: SQL, Python, R, Tableau, Excel

🍵 Off the clock: Venturing through the city for the best matcha (with my long-running ranked list), dancing, and discovering new dessert spots.

📥 Let’s Connect! I’d love to chat with you about anything ranging from data to your favorite matcha in the city!
